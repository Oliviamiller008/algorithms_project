#Enter workout type (Cardio, Legs, Arms, Back), and based on workout type, we reference a specific dynamic programming table

#Create specific tables/dictionaries per workout type for algo to reference

#Algorithm goes here



#prints a dictionary "Workout schedule day 1: Cycling, xx minutes, xxx kcal; biking, xx minutes, xxx kcal"
print("Workout schedule day 1:", "schedule") 
#print("Total Calories burned day 1: <calculation to be created, sample only>", weight*df.iloc[0]["Calories per kg"], "kcal")


#TODO

#COMPLETE - Import dataset and create variables
#Verify that calories burned pr kg is accurate (right now, values do not match column values)
#Remove unecessary activities from file (python edit or csv edit?)
#Add column for calories per minute to use in function (currently only calories per hour, simple /60)
#Add column for activity limits (this will be used in our dynamic programming table, minutes:calories)
#Create dictionary/hash table for day 1 for algorithm to reference
